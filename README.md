**ReproModel**  helps the AI research community to <strong>reproduce and compare AI models</strong> faster.

ReproModel toolbox revolutionizes research efficiency by providing standardized models, dataloaders, and processing procedures. It features a comprehensive suite of pre-existing experiments, a code extractor, and an LLM descriptor. This toolbox <strong>allows researchers to focus on new datasets and model development</strong>, significantly reducing time and computational costs.

With this <strong>no-code solution</strong>, you'll have access to a collection of benchmark and SOTA models and datasets. Dive into training visualizations, effortlessly extract code for publication, and let our LLM-powered automated methodology description writer do the heavy lifting.

The current prototype helps researchers to modularize their development and compare the performance of <strong>each step in the pipeline in a reproducible way</strong>. This prototype version helped us reduce the time for model development, computation, and writing by at least 40%. Watch our [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQHZMEloUps).

The coming versions will help researchers build upon state-of-the-art research faster by just <strong>loading the previously published study ID</strong>. All code, experiments, and results will already be verified and stored in our system.

## Documentation
For examples and step-by-step instructions, please visit our full documentation at https://www.repromodel.com/docs. (COMING SOON)

## Running Locally
You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.<br/> 

**Combines npm install, creation of a virtual environment, as well as the launch of the frontend and backend:**
```
npm run repromodel
```

**Launch the frontend instead individually:**
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
