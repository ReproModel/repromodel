# :clipboard: Description

  

**ReproModel**  helps the AI research community to reproduce and compare AI models faster.

The current prototype helps them to modularize their development and compare the performance of each step in the pipeline in a reproducible way.

The next version will help researchers to build upon state-of-the-art research faster by just loading the previously published study ID. All code, experiments, and results would already be verified, and stored in the system. The prototype version helped us reduce the time for model development, computation, and writing by at least 40%.
