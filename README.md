# :clipboard: Description

**ReproModel**  helps the AI research community to reproduce and compare AI models faster.

The current prototype helps researchers to modularize their development and compare the performance of each step in the pipeline in a reproducible way.

The following version will help researchers to build upon state-of-the-art research faster by just loading the previously published study ID. All code, experiments, and results would already be verified, and stored in the system. The prototype version helped us reduce the time for model development, computation, and writing by at least 40%.

# :bulb: How to Run
For running the frontend locally, you need to have Node.js installed.</br> 
If missing, install Node.js for your operating system from [here](https://nodejs.org)</br></br>

Run the following commands to launch the backend and frontend locally:</br>
<code>npm run repromodel</code></br></br>
This command combines npm install, creation of a virtual environment, as well as the launch of the frontend and backend.</br></br>

If you want to launch the frontend instead individually you can do so with:</br>
<code>npm install</code></br>
<code>npm run dev</code></br>

Or you can look at the latest live (frontend only) version here:</br>
